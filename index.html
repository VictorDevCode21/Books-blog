            <p>Finding something important and meaningful in your life is the most productive use of your time and energy. This is true because every life has problems associated with it and finding meaning in your life will help you sustain the effort needed to overcome the particular problems you face.
            Thus, we can say that the key to living a good life is not giving a fuck about more things, but rather, giving a fuck only about the things that align with your personal values.</p>

            <h2>48 Laws Of Power</h2>
            <p>Power is an integral part of our societies and lives. In “The 48 Laws of Power”, Robert Greene distills 3,000 years of history into 48 laws to help us understand how we can masterfully acquire power and avoid being manipulated or crushed by others.</p>

            <p>No one likes being powerless, yet we don’t take well to power-hungry people due to our modern ideologies of fairness, equity etc. It’s important to realize that power is amoral—it’s neither good nor evil. You can choose how to use power once you have it, but it’d be foolish to dismiss power as bad or unimportant. In fact, there’s much that we can learn from the masterful scheming of the aristocratic courts of the past—those who can subtly charm, deceive and manipulate without others’ awareness can rise to power without others’ resentment or resistance. <br><br>
            Greene encourages us to think of power-play as a game. You can use this book to learn about power in general, or study and reflect deeply upon the ideas to truly understand people and the world you live in.</p>

            <h2>Ego Is The Enemy</h2>
            <p>Ego Is The Enemy is about the problems our ego posses to us in three distinct stages in our life— when we’re climbing toward success, when we’re on top, and when we’re falling down. The book helps us deal with ego problems in all three stages.</p>
            <img src="img/Ego is the enemy.png" width="400"/>
            <p>I’ve used different lessons from the book in different times. When I was young, hungry, and ambitious, it helped me move the ego on the side and stay humble. When I matured and racked up a couple of victories in life, it helped me focus on the things that got me there in the first place. The process is the one that counts. This is a book you can pick up every 5 years in your life and extract completely different lessons.</p>
